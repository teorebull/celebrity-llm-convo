ISTJ – THE INSPECTOR,"Motto:Organizing everything (Source)
Description:(Source)
ISTJs thrive on organization. They keep their lives and environments well-regulated. They bring painstaking attention to detail in their work and will not rest until a job is well completed.
They are often dissatisfied with unresolved issues, whether in life or in fiction.

ISTJs are faithful, logical, organized, sensible, and earnest traditionalists. They earn success by thoroughness and dependability.
Shutting out distractions, they take a practical, logical approach to their endeavors. Realistic and responsible, they work steadily toward their goals.
They enjoy creating order in both their professional and personal lives.
Despite their focus on their internal world, ISTJs prefer dealing with the present and the factual. Keen observers of life, they weigh various options when making decisions.
ISTJs are well-prepared for most eventualities and have a good understanding of most situations. They believe in practical objectives, and they value traditions and loyalty.
ISTJs learn best and apply themselves to subjects that they deem practical and useful. As learners, ISTJs tend to need materials, directions, and teachers to be precise and accurate if they are to trust the information that is presented.
They prefer concrete and useful applications and will tolerate theory only if it leads to these ends.
They like learning activities that allow them time to reflect and think. Material that seems too easy or too enjoyable leads ISTJs to be skeptical of its merit.
Because of their practical outlook, ISTJs clearly delineate between work and play. Therefore, their ideal learning environment is task-oriented, has a clear schedule, and has a clear and precise assignment.
ISTJs respect facts. They hold a tremendous store of data within themselves, gathered through their Sensing function.
They may have difficulty valuing a theory or idea that differs from their own perspective. However, if they are shown the importance or relevance of the idea by someone whom they respect or care about, the idea becomes a fact that the ISTJ will internalize and vigorously support.
ISTJs often work for long periods, devoting their energy to tasks that they see as important to fulfilling a goal. However, they resist putting energy into things that don’t make sense to them, or for which they can’t see a practical application.
They prefer to work alone but can work well in teams when the situation demands it. They like to be accountable for their actions, and they enjoy positions of responsibility.
They have little use for theory or abstract thinking, unless the practical application is clear.
In general, ISTJs are capable, logical, reasonable, and effective individuals with a deeply driven desire to promote security and peaceful living. They can be highly effective at achieving their goals—whatever those may be.

They tend to have aesthetically pleasing living spaces because they put a lot of thought into the design and flow of their house.
They have a knack for making friends and family feel safe and welcomed in their presence. But because they are always thinking of others’ needs, ISFJs become vulnerable to being taken advantage of.

Using their intuitive skills, they develop a clear and confident vision, which they then set out to execute, aiming to better the lives of others.
Like theirINTJ counterparts, INFJs regard problems as opportunities to design and implement creative solutions.

Sensitive and complex, they are adept at understanding complicated issues and driven to resolve differences in a cooperative and creative manner.
INFJs have a rich, vivid inner life, which they may be reluctant to share with those around them. Nevertheless, they are congenial in their interactions, and perceptive of the emotions of others.
Generally well-liked by their peers, they may often be considered close friends and confidants by most other types. However, they are guarded in expressing their own feelings, especially to new people, and so tend to establish close relationships slowly.
INFJs tend to be easily hurt, though they may not reveal this except to their closest companions.
INFJs may “silently withdraw as a way of setting limits”, rather than expressing their wounded feelings—a behavior that may leave others confused and upset.
INFJs tend to be sensitive, quiet leaders with a great depth of personality. They are intricately and deeply woven, mysterious, and highly complex, sometimes puzzling even to themselves.
They have an orderly view toward the world, but are internally arranged in a complex way that only they can understand.
Abstract in communicating, they live in a world of hidden meanings and possibilities.
With a natural affinity for art, INFJs tend to be creative and easily inspired. Yet they may also do well in the sciences, aided by their intuition.
"
INTJ – THE MASTERMIND,"Motto:Can improve on anything (Source)
Description:(Source)INTJs are analytical.Like INTPs, they are most comfortable working alone and tend to be less sociable than other types.
Nevertheless, INTJs are prepared to lead if no one else seems up to the task, or if they see a major weakness in the current leadership. They tend to be pragmatic, logical, and creative.
They have a low tolerance for spin or rampant emotionalism. They are not generally susceptible to catchphrases and do not recognize authority based on tradition, rank, or title.
Strengths:Hallmarks of the INTJ include independence of thought and a desire for efficiency. They work best when given autonomy and creative freedom.

They harbor an innate desire to express themselves by conceptualizing their own intellectual designs. They have a talent for analyzing and formulating complex theories.
INTJs are generally well-suited for occupations within academia, research, consulting, management, science, engineering, and law.
They are often acutely aware of their own knowledge and abilities–as well as their limitations and what they don’t know (a quality that tends to distinguish them from INTP’s). INTJs thus develop a strong confidence in their ability and talents, making them natural leaders.
Friendships:Checkthe INTJ Friendship Experience.
Relationships:(Checkthe INTJ Romantic Relationshipsfor more in-depth analysis.)
In forming relationships, INTJs tend to seek out others with similar character traits and ideologies. Agreement on theoretical concepts is an important aspect of their relationships.
By nature INTJs can be demanding in their expectations, and approach relationships in a rational manner. As a result, INTJs may not always respond to a spontaneous infatuation but wait for a mate who better fits their set criteria.
They tend to be stable, reliable, and dedicated. Harmony in relationships and home life tends to be extremely important to them.
They generally withhold strong emotion and do not like to waste time with what they consider irrational social rituals. This may cause non-INTJs to perceive them as distant and reserved; nevertheless, INTJs are usually very loyal partners who are prepared to commit substantial energy and time into a relationship to make it work.
As mates, INTJs want harmony and order in the home and in relationships.
The most independent of all types, INTJs trust their intuition when choosing friends and mates–even in spite of contradictory evidence or pressure from others.
The emotions of an INTJ are hard to read, and neither male nor female INTJs are apt to express emotional reactions.
At times, INTJs seem cold, reserved, and unresponsive, while in fact they are almost hypersensitive to signals of rejection from those they care for.
Family Life:Checkthe INTJ Family LifeandINTJ as a parent.
Education:Checkthe INTJ Education Experience.
Social Weaknesses:In social situations, INTJs may also be unresponsive and may neglect small rituals designed to put others at ease. For example, INTJs may communicate that idle dialogue such as small talk is a waste of time. This may create the impression that the INTJ is in a hurry–an impression that is not always intended.
In their interpersonal relationships, INTJs are usually better in a working situation than in a recreational situation.
"
ISTP – THE CRAFTSMAN,"Motto:Working with facts and hands (Source)
Description:(Source)ISTPs excel at analyzing situations to reach the heart of a problem so that they can swiftly implement a functional repair, making them ideally suited to the field of engineering.
Naturally quiet people, they are interested in understanding how systems operate, focusing on efficient operation and structure. They are open to new information and approaches.

But contrary to their seemingly detached natures, ISTPs are often capable of humorously insightful observations about the world around them.
They can also be closet daredevils who gravitate toward fast-moving or risky hobbies (such as bungee jumping, hang gliding, racing, motorcycling, and parachuting), recreational sports (such as downhill skiing, paintball, ice hockey, and scuba diving), and careers (such as aviation and firefighting).
ISTPs may sometimes seem to act without regard for procedures, directions, protocol, or even their own safety.
But while their approach may seem haphazard, it is in fact based on a broad store of knowledge developed over time through action and keen observation.
ISTPs enjoy self-sufficiency and take pride in developing their own solutions to problems.
ISTPs are content to let others live according to their own rules, as long as the favor is reciprocated.
ISTPs endure reasonable impositions without complaint–but if their “territory” is encroached upon, eroded, or violated, they defend what they view as rightfully theirs.
"
ISFP – THE ARTIST,"Motto:Marching to a different drummer (Source)
Description:(Source)ISFPs are peaceful, easygoing people who adopt a “live and let live” approach to life. They enjoy taking things at their own pace and tend to live in the moment.
Although quiet, they are pleasant, considerate, caring, and devoted to the people in their lives.
Though not inclined to debate or necessarily even air their views, their values are important to them.

Introverted and quiet, ISFPs are difficult to build a close relationship with. They usually have a small circle of friends and family who they have had relationships with over long periods of time.
Even though it takes ISFPs a long time to open up to others, once they do they have a lot to say. ISF’s are deep thinkers who walk to the beat of their own drum.
ISFPs tend to examine the world with all five of their senses. They thrive on experiencing every aspect of the present moment by taking in the sight, feel, touch, smell, and sounds of life as much as they possibly can.
This makes them incredibly talented artists who are able to breath life into their art. They excel in positions where they can follow their own personal value system while also expressing themselves creatively.
Motivated by their sympathetic nature, ISFPs are always ready to help anyone in need. They have an intuitive understanding of what other people are thinking and feeling which makes them skilled in helping others.
However, ISFPs have a tendency to become overly critical of themselves due to their strong sense of values and are not quick to take credit for their work.
Relentlessly humble, ISFPs prefer to have their work and service speak for themselves.
ISFPs also enjoy spending a lot of time in the quiet calm of nature where they can clear their heads and figure things out for themselves.
They value their alone time more than most people. In fact, they rely on solitude to unwind and gain perspective.
They may appear to have a care free attitude, but those who know the ISFP would say they are serious and focused.
And because they take life so seriously, ISFPs often feel overwhelmed by the world. But they overcome these obstacles with their altruistic nature and artistic abilities.
"
INFP – THE IDEALIST,"Motto:Pursuing ideals (Source)
Description:(Source)The polite, reserved exterior of INFPs can at first make them difficult to get to know. They enjoy conversation, however, taking particular delight in the unusual.
When INFPs are in a sociable mood, their humor and charm shine through. Disposed to like people and to avoid conflict, INFPs tend to make pleasant company.

Devoted to those in their inner circle, INFPs guard the emotional well-being of others, consoling those in distress.
Guided by their desire for harmony, INFPs prefer to be flexible unless their ethics are violated. Then, they become passionate advocates for their beliefs.
They are often able to sway the opinions of others through tact, diplomacy, and an ability to see varying sides of an issue.
INFPs develop these insights through reflection, and they require substantial time alone to ponder and process new information.
While they can be quite patient with complex material, they are generally bored by routine. Though not always organized, INFPs are meticulous about things they value.
Perfectionists, they may have trouble completing a task because it cannot meet their high standards. They may even go back to a completed project after the deadline so they can improve it.
INFPs are creative types and often have a gift for language. As introverts, they may prefer to express themselves through writing.
Their dominant Feeling drives their desire to communicate, while their auxiliary intuition supplies the imagination.
Having a talent for symbolism, they enjoy metaphors and similes. They continually seek new ideas and adapt well to change.
They prefer working in an environment that values these gifts and allows them to make a positive difference in the world, according to their personal beliefs.
"
INTP – THE SCIENTIST,"Motto:Always analytical (Source)
Description:(Source)INTPs are quiet, thoughtful, analytical individuals who tend to spend long periods of time on their own, working through problems and forming solutions.
They are curious about systems and how things work. Consequently, they are frequently found in careers such as science, philosophy, law, and architecture.

INTPs tend to be less at ease in social situations or in the “caring professions”, although they enjoy the company of those who share their interests. They prize autonomy in themselves and others.
They generally balk at attempts by others to convince them to change. They also tend to be impatient with the bureaucracy, rigid hierarchies, and the politics prevalent in many professions.
INTPs have little regard for titles and badges, which they often consider to be unjustified. INTP’s usually come to distrust authority as hindering the uptake of novel ideas and the search for knowledge.
INTPs accept ideas based on merit, rather than tradition or authority.
They have little patience for social customs that seem illogical or that serve as obstacles for pursuing ideas and knowledge. This may place them at odds with people who have an SJ preference, since SJs tend to defer to authority, tradition, and what the rest of the group is doing.
INTPs prefer to work informally with others as equals.
INTPs organize their understanding of any topic by articulating principles, and they are especially drawn to theoretical constructs. Having articulated these principles for themselves, they can demonstrate remarkable skill in explaining complex ideas to others in simple terms, especially in writing.
On the other hand, their ability to grasp complexity may also lead them to provide overly detailed explanations of simple ideas, and listeners may judge that the INTP makes things more difficult than they need to be.
To the INTPs’ mind, they are presenting all the relevant information or trying to crystallize the concept as clearly as possible.
Given their independent nature, INTPs may prefer working alone to leading or following in a group.
During interactions with others, if INTPs are focused on gathering information, they may seem oblivious, aloof, or even rebellious–when in fact they are concentrating on listening and understanding.
However, INTPs’ extraverted intuition often gives them a quick wit, especially with language. They may defuse tension through comical observations and references.
They can be charming, even in their quiet reserve, and are sometimes surprised by the high esteem in which their friends and colleagues hold them.
INTP’s are driven to fully understand a discussion from all relevant angles. Their impatience with seemingly indefensible ideas can make them particularly devastating at debate.
When INTPs feel insulted, they may respond with sudden, cutting criticism. After such an incident, INTPs are likely to be as bewildered as the recipient. They have broken the rules of debate and exposed their raw emotions.
To INTPs, this is the crux of the problem: improperly handled emotions, INTPs believe, can only harm.
While INTP’s experience emotions as an important part of their internal lives, and sometimes share their emotions with others, INTP’s nevertheless believe that emotions must not play a role in logical discussions, or be expressed in a way that would put themselves at disadvantage.

Description:(Source)ESTPs are hands-on learners who live in the moment, seeking the best in life, wanting to share it with their friends.

An ESTP may find it difficult to work in highly organized environments that require a great deal of focused discussions.

An ESTP will be a natural group leader who can quickly identify the strengths and weaknesses of each member of their team.
ESTPs have a unique knack for picking up on slight details such as a change in a person’s facial expressions and body language.
As soon as an ESTP senses an unspoken thought or shift in mood from another individual, they are quick to bring it into the open and ask questions to get to the heart of the matter. While this ability to perceive the motives of others can be beneficial, it can also be off-putting to those who prefer not to have their secrets revealed so easily.
The passionate and energetic nature of ESTPs make them ideal entrepreneurs provided they can enjoy active participation in running their business.
Hands-on careers, such as construction, emergency services and the military are also ideal careers for an ESTP. They also thrive in the public eye and may enjoy working as a salesperson, comedian or actor.
Eddie Murphy, Madonna and Bruce Willis are among the more well-known ESTPs.
As long as an ESTP can harness their high energy and point it in a positive direction, they can conquer any challenge they encounter while promoting success for everyone with whom they come in contact.

ESFP’s are excellent team players, focused on completing the task at hand with maximum fun and minimum discord.
Active types, they find pleasure in new experiences.

ESFP’s take a hands-on approach in most things. Because they learn more by doing than by studying or reading, they tend to rush into things, learning by interacting with their environment.
They usually dislike theory and written explanations.
Traditional schools can be difficult for ESFP’s, although they tend to do well when the subject of study interests them, or when they see the relevance of a subject and are allowed to interact with people.
Observant, practical, realistic, and specific, ESFP’s make decisions according to their own personal standards.
They use their Feeling judgment internally to identify and empathize with others. Naturally attentive to the world around them,

They are especially good at mobilizing people to deal with crises. Generous, optimistic, and persuasive, they are good at interpersonal interactions.
They often play the role of peacemaker due to their warm, sympathetic, and tactful nature.
ESFP’s love being around people and having new experiences. Living in the here-and-now, they often do not think about long term effects or the consequences of their actions.
While very practical, they generally despise routines, instead desiring to “go with the flow.”
They are, in fact, very play minded. Because ESFP’s learn better through hands-on experience, classroom learning may be troublesome for many of them, especially those with a very underdeveloped intuitive side.
"
ENFP – THE DISCOVERER,"Motto:In search of myself (Source)
Description:(Source)ENFPs are initiators of change, keenly perceptive of possibilities. They energize and stimulate others through their contagious enthusiasm.

ENFPs live their life following a strong set of values and everything they do resides from those values, including their career.
Their consistency comes from their own personal set of values that will never be betrayed.
ENFPs are constantly aware of everything around them, searching the world for inner peace and their “true self.” Often, this results in fear of losing themselves. ENFPs strive off of emotion, which can cause them to be highly intense and emotional. All of these facts are why values are so important in the life of a ENFP.
Since ENFPs are so enthusiastic, they have to take the time to be alone and focus in order to finish a project.
Their work is important to them, but without time to get centered, they often lose track and drop commitments. However, ENFPs that keep their focus and remain centered in their values tend to be highly successful in their personal as well as professional endeavors.
ENFPs have to remind themselves to keep with their current projects rather than getting excited about the next big thing. Since an ENFP is driven by their emotions, they have to be reminded to let their brain have a part in their decisions and not just their heart.
ENFPs contain excellent people skills. They are genuinely interested in people and what makes them tick. Inter-personal relationships are very important in the life of an ENFP.
They have an intense desire to be liked by other people. Sometimes this can result in trying too hard to be accepted.
However, once an ENFP has found a way to be true to who they are while also spending time with other people, they truly bring out the best in everyone around them.
When they take the time, ENFPs contain the ability to understand someone after only a short period of time and can use their natural intuition as well as their flexibility to relate to their peers.
"
ENTP – THE INVENTOR,"Motto:One Idea After Another (Source)

ENTP’s are ingenious and adept at directing relationships between means and ends.
ENTP’s devise fresh, unexpected solutions to difficult problems. However, they are less interested in generating and following through with detailed plans than in generating ideas and possibilities.

An ESTJ prefers to lead by example and believes that authority is earned through hard work, dedication and honesty.
They abhor laziness and cheating, and instead stick to their principles with unclouded judgment by sticking to the facts of a matter.
ESTJ’s excel in administer roles that enable them to sort through the details of challenging projects to identify a way to break them down into manageable tasks. With these traits, it is no wonder that many of the U.S. presidents have been ESTJ’s.
Although ESTJ’s will be the first to take the lead, they recognize their need for assistance from others. Yet, they tend to hold their colleagues up to the same expectations they set for themselves.
In business matters, ESTJ’s can be unyielding and unable to see other’s perspectives when they do not match up to the facts.
If there is a weakness to be found in this personality type, it would be inflexibility as an ESTJ will hold their view even in the face of heavy resistance. However, an ESTJ who can overcome this rigid mindset will be able to utilize the input of others to maximize their leadership potential.
In social situations, ESTJ’s tend to represent a pillar of the community by organizing and hosting events. Yet, they do know how to project their boisterous personality and have fun mingling with others.

"
ESFJ – THE CAREGIVER,"Motto:Getting things done (Source)
Description:(Source)ESFJ’s focus on the outside world and assess their experiences subjectively. They largely base their judgments on their belief system and on the effects of actions on people.
ESFJ’s are literal and concrete, trusting the specific, factual information gathered through their physiological senses.

ESFJ’s project warmth through a genuine interest in the well-being of others.
They are often skilled at bringing out the best in people, and they want to understand other points of view. They are serious about their responsibilities, seeing what needs to be done and then doing it.

As expert people readers, ESFJ’s often adapt their manner to meet the expectations of others. However, they may have difficulty recognizing the shortcomings of loved ones.
ESFJ’s tend to be vocal in expressing their sense of right and wrong. Their value system derives from the external standards defined by their community, as opposed to a personal set of ethics. (This is one of the traits that distinguishes them from their ENFJ counterparts.)
ESFJ’s raised in an environment of high ethical standards tend to display true generosity and kindness. However, those who grow up surrounded by a skewed set of values may develop a false sense of integrity and use their people skills to selfishly manipulate others–particularly if their intuition is poorly developed, leaving them unable to foresee the consequences of their actions.
ESFJ’s seek structured, controlled environments, and tend to be good at creating a sense of order. They generally feel insecure in an atmosphere of uncertainty.
They value the rule of law and expect the same of others. ESFJ’s may be less interested in understanding the concepts behind the rules, tending to shy away from the abstract and impersonal.
"

"
ENTJ – THE CEO,"Motto:To live is to lead (Source)
Description:(Source)ENTJs focus on the most efficient and organized means of performing a task. This quality, along with their goal orientation, often makes ENTJs superior leaders, both realistic and visionary in implementing a long-term plan.
ENTJs tend to be fiercely independent in their decision making, having a strong will that insulates them against external influence.

Generally highly competent, ENTJs analyze and structure the world around them in a logical and rational way. Due to this straightforward way of thinking, ENTJs tend to have the greatest difficulty of all the types in applying subjective considerations and emotional values into the decision-making process.
ENTJs often excel in business and other areas that require systems analysis, original thinking, and an economically savvy mind. They are dynamic and pragmatic problem solvers. They tend to have a high degree of confidence in their own abilities, making them assertive and outspoken.
In their dealings with others, they are generally outgoing, charismatic, fair-minded, and unaffected by conflict or criticism. However, these qualities can make ENTJs appear arrogant, insensitive, and confrontational.
They can overwhelm others with their energy, intelligence, and desire to order the world according to their own vision. As a result, they may seem intimidating, hasty, and controlling.
ENTJs tend to cultivate their personal power. They often end up taking charge of a situation that seems (to their mind, at least) to be out of control, or that can otherwise be improved upon and strengthened.
They strive to learn new things, which helps them become resourceful problem-solvers. However, since ENTJs rely on provable facts, they may find subjective issues pointless.
ENTJs appear to take a tough approach to emotional or personal issues, and so can be viewed as aloof and insensitive. In situations requiring feeling and value judgments, ENTJs are well served to seek the advice of a trusted Feeling type.
When striving toward a goal, ENTJs often put personal needs aside until the work is done (and may expect others to do the same). For this reason, ENTJs may be considered self-sacrificing by some, but “cold and heartless” by others, especially those who prefer Feeling.
